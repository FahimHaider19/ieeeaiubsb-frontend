            After that, <strong>Prof. David B. Grayden</strong> started his session by explaining the epileptic seizures and talked about how big data and deep learning can be used to predict them.
            He also explained how deep learning neural networks could be used for understanding the input-output relationships of epileptic seizures. He talked about the Kaggle competition that took
            place in the past, where 478 teams participated and submitted 10082 algorithms on Crowd-Sourcing Reproducible Seizures Prediction concepts. He also displayed some of the selected works
            from the competition. Then, he talked about different types of seizure cycles, taking other environmental conditions into account.
          </p>
          <p>
            He portrayed graphical representations of the seizure cycles from the previous research works for enriching his explanations. Later, Prof. Grayden gave an overview of the current research
            works which are going on as a part of the treatment of epileptic seizures. He also gave an overview of how patients can predict their seizures using a minimally invasive seizure
            forecasting app from their smartphones. Besides, he talked about the ongoing research works where biomedical engineers are working for the efficient determination of seizure forecasting
            through machine learning and long-term EEG. Then, an interactive question-answer session took place where the speaker answered all the questions from the participants.
