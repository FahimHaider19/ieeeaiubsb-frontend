                  In 12th December 2006 IEEE AIUB Student Branch was formed
                  under the administration of Office of Student Affairs (OSA),
                  AIUB in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is a registered Student Branch
                  under the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
                  (IEEE), based in Piscataway, NJ, USA. The student branch began
                  with just a handful of members and minimal activities, but
                  there was a dream, a hope, and a drive to
                  <em>advance technology for the benefit of humanity</em>.
                  Pursuing this goal, the IEEE AIUB Student Branch team
                  developed the Student Branch over the years 2009 to 2012.After
                  that the next generation of IEEE AIUB Student Branch set a
                  target and a vision to reach the very top. What the Student
                  Branch represents today and in its current glory is the result
                  of all those years of arduous work, passion, and dedication.
                  In 2014 IEEE AIUB Student Branch received 1st place in Best
                  Student Branch Award 2014 at IEEE Bangladesh Section Annual
                  Dinner & Awards Ceremony. Also, in 2020 and 2022 it received
                  <em>IEEE Regional Exemplary Student Branch Award</em> in IEEE
                  Region 10. It received 35+ awards from 2014 to 2022.

                  The hard work of its members and their support contributed to
                  the IEEE AIUB Student Branch&apos;s success. Without their
                  dedication, the founder&apos;s dream would have been
                  incomplete. We appreciate and salute all the members of IEEE
                  AIUB Student Branch for their efforts.
