            IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) is the
            worldâ€™s largest technical professional organization dedicated to
            advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. IEEE was
            established in 1963 with the goals of fostering technological
            innovation, developing standards, and advancing science, technology,
            and engineering. Through its widely recognized publications,
            conferences, technical standards, professional, and educational
            activities, IEEE and its members motivate a global community. It is
            known for developing and publishing industry standards, conducting
            conferences, and providing educational and professional development
            opportunities. IEEE has a broad scope and covers a wide range of
            technological fields, including electrical engineering, computer
            science, telecommunications, biomedical engineering, and many
            others. The association has more than 420,000 members in more than
            160 countries of different professions like researchers, students,
            and practitioners from these fields, who collaborate to drive
